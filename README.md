# Wi-Fi Console
*Turn your WLAN Pi in to a wireless serial console cable*

It can be annoying to have to sit in an equipment room to use the serial console port on an item of networking equipment. This module allows you to use a WLAN Pi to connect to your serial console cable via a Wi-Fi link while sat in the comfort of a nearby office, rather than sat with your laptop on the equipment room floor :)
